# Human Strategies for Single Finger Texture Exploration

## Overview

This repository contains the dataset and analysis code for the study **"Human Strategies for Single Finger Texture Exploration"**, which investigates how humans use a single finger to explore and perceive textures. The study examines texture perception across 5 perceptual dimensions—traction, roughness, coarseness, hardness, and temperature—and their relationships with exploration parameters such as applied force and scanning speed. 

The original dataset included questionnaire responses, video recordings, and force measurements from 40 participants.

## Experiment Summary

- **Participants**: 40 individuals (32 males, 8 females), aged 20-60.
- **Textures**: 10 different material textures mounted on acrylic plates.
- **Perceptual Dimensions**:
  - **Traction**: Describes the "stickiness" of the texture, i.e., whether the hand or finger easily slides over the texture (-) or tends to stick to it (+).
  - **Roughness**: Describes whether the surface of the texture is smooth (-) or rough (+).
  - **Coarseness**: Describes the size of features of the texture, i.e., whether there are noticeable bumps that feel coarse (+) or any irregularities that are indistinguishable, feel fine (-). To avoid confusion with Roughness, this dimension was set to **Fineness** during data collection.
  - **Hardness**: Describes the hardness (+) or softness (-) of the texture, i.e., how it reacts to pressure.
  - **Temperature**: Describes the temperature sensation of the texture, i.e., whether it feels hot (+) or cold (-).
- **Data Collection**:
  - Force data was recorded using a **RobotiQ FT300-S force torque sensor**.
  - Video data was recorded using a **ELP USB Camera 1080P High Speed 260fps**.
  - Participants rated textures on a **-10 to +10 scale** across 5 perceptual dimensions above using **Qualtrics** online questionaire (https://www.qualtrics.com/).
